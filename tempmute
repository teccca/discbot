this command only works in seconds at the moment, but once I find out how to convert the time in minutes, hours and days I'll change it

import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import os
import asyncio

@client.command()
@commands.has_permissions(kick_members=True) 
async def tempmute(ctx, member: discord.Member, time=0, *, reason=None): 
  if time==0:
    await ctx.send("You need to type in a valid amount of time")
    return
  if reason==None:
    await ctx.send("You need to type in a valid reason")
    return
  rolemuted = discord.utils.get(ctx.guild.roles, name="Muted") < gets the role
  await member.add_roles(rolemuted) < adds the role
  await ctx.send(f"{member.mention} has been muted for {time} seconds for {reason}")
  await member.send(f"{member.mention} , you have been muted for {time} seconds for {reason}")
  await asyncio.sleep(time) < makes it so once time gets to 0 the role "Muted" is removed
  await member.remove_roles(rolemuted) < removes the "Muted" role
  await member.send(f"Times up {member.mention} , be good this time")
